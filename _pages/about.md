I am an AI research scientist at <a href="http://kakaobrain.com">
KakaoBrain</a>.
Prior to joining KakaoBrain, I had led a machine learning team at <a href="http://aitrics.com">AITRICS</a>
(medical AI startup).

I finished my Ph.D. and B.S. degrees in the <a href="http://cse.postech.ac.kr">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at
POSTECH. I had spent several months for internship programs at MSRA and MSR.
During my Ph.D., I had studied both randomized and learning algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search.

My research interests lie in continual learning, Bayesian deep learning,
locality-sensitive hashing, and machine learning for healthcare.
