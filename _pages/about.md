I am an AI research scientist at KakaoBrain.
Prior to joining KakaoBrain, I had led a machine learning team at AITRICS
(medical AI startup).

I finished my Ph.D. and B.S. degrees in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
POSTECH. I had spent several months for internship programs at MSRA and MSR.
During my Ph.D. program, I had studied locality-sensitive hashing algorithms for approximate
nearest neighbor search.

My research interests lie in continual learning, Bayesian deep learning,
locality-sensitive hashing, and machine learning for healthcare.
